# NIST SP 800-88 Revision 2 – Guidelines for Media Sanitization

**Released:** September 26, 2025  
**Scope:** Data sanitization and disposal programs for all storage media types.

## Key Updates
- Focuses on organization-wide sanitization programs rather than device-specific methods.
- Adds cloud, virtual, and logical sanitization techniques.
- Reinforces validation, documentation, and verification of sanitization steps.

**Plain English:**  
Organizations must now treat data destruction as a managed process—tracking, verifying, and validating how every piece of storage media is cleaned or destroyed.
