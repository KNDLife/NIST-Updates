# NIST SP 800-90C – Random Bit Generator Constructions

**Released:** September 25, 2025  
**Focus:** Ensuring strong random number generation for secure cryptography.

## Key Points
- Defines four classes of random bit generators.
- Combines deterministic and entropy-based randomness.
- Standardizes best practices for cryptographic and non-cryptographic randomness.

**Plain English:**  
This ensures random numbers used in encryption and secure systems are truly unpredictable, protecting against weaknesses in random number generation.
